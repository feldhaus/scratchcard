# SCRATCHCARD
A simple 3x3 scratchcard game coded in Typescript using PIXI.js.

## Setup

### 1. Install node.js and npm:
https://nodejs.org

### 2. Clone this repo:
```git clone https://github.com/feldhaus/scratchcard.git```

### 3. Install dependencies:
Navigate to the cloned repo's directory and run:
```npm install```.

### 4. Run the development server:
Run the following command in the cloned repo's directory:
```npm run dev```.
This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.
Open your browser and enter localhost:9000 into the address bar.
Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser

### 5. Build for deployment:
Run the following command in the cloned repo's directory:
```npm run build```.
This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle in the dist folder.
